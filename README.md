### Following are The Key Points About Project

<br>

1.  ### Abstraction üéó

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional set of values used for storing numerical information, 
depicting transformations on a coordinate plane, computing statistical data, or even 
encoding neural networks. Matrix computations are taught in linear algebra and 
advanced modeling courses in college curricula, in preparation for use in real 
occupations. 
Current free matrix calculators are often inaccurate, function under a user interface 
that is difficult to navigate, or lack important traits such as exportable data. The goal 
of the project was to engineer an application that performs most college-level matrix 
calculations while maximizing computational accuracy and usability. The program 
was coded to include a list of attributes that functioned as guidelines for optimizing 
the interface. 
The calculator‚Äôs performance was compared to other programs using function 
accuracy tests and a scoring matrix that included user interface assessments. A free 
matrix calculator with maximal usability and exact computational results will make 
calculations faster and easier, allowing matrices to truly become the standardized 
format for data storage.</p>

2.  ### Introduction üôå

<p>Matrices are used in many different areas of math. They are useful for calculating 
changes in two-dimensional motion and in making changes to large groups of data. 
This method of storage is compact, reliable, and versatile, as it can be converted into 
many different forms.
However, even basic calculations with matrices can be tedious; operations as basic as 
multiplication require realigning the two factor matrices and multiplying long strings 
of elements for each section of the product matrix. For this reason, it is more efficient 
to use programmed calculators to perform operations on these data types.
In that project we perform various operation on matrix in C. Every Operation perform 
on 2*2, 3*3 and 4*4 matrix. The reason is that all operation required same no of row 
and Column for Operation. So, for simplicity we make it menu driven for required 
order of Matrix.

3.  ### Programming Language ‚úÇ

<p>This System can be coded in any of the programming languages. We will be using C to code our own System named Matrix Calculator Using Threads. This Project Used Threads for the excuetion of each matrix Operation</p>

4.  ### Matrix Operations 

    As we Know that there are various Operation of Matrix in C. We have Performed that Operation with a Cursor Blinking Input. We have Performed Some of its Operation on Matrix which are given Below:

 <p>

        0.  Addition.
        1.  Subtraction.
        2.  Multiplication.
        3.  Scalar Multiplication.
        4.  Transpose.
        5.  Determinant.
        6.  Singular and Non-Singular Matrix.
